# Lukas Sivak â€“ Frontend Developer Portfolio

Hi! Iâ€™m Lukas, a frontend developer with a background in hospitality and a growing passion for creating intuitive, responsive web interfaces. This is the home of my developer portfolio â€” a collection of projects Iâ€™ve built while learning and experimenting, along with a glimpse into the tools I use and the direction Iâ€™m heading.

Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into **JavaScript** and **React**, and enjoy building projects that feel real and useful.
